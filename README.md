Airline Performance Analytics Dashboard
🎯 Purpose: A dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze flight delays, cancellations, and airline operational efficiency [Practice Project].
✨ Key Features:

📊 Real-time Metrics: Tracked 2M flights with filters for delays (790K), cancellations (28.6K), and on-time rates (58%).

🔍 Root-Cause Analysis: Identified weather (58%) and security (41%) as top delay factors using DAX-driven calculations.

🏙️ Geographic Insights: Compared flight volumes across hubs (e.g., Atlanta: 0.35M flights, Chicago: 0.38M flights).

📉 Airline Performance: Ranked carriers like Southwest Airlines (51% on-time) and Spirit Air Lines (43% on-time).
🛠️ Technologies: Power BI (DAX, Drill-throughs, Custom Tooltips), Excel (Data Cleaning).
🌟 My Role: Solo developer – Designed data models, wrote DAX formulas, and created interactive visuals.
🔥 Challenges & Wins:

Optimized slow-loading datasets using DAX time-intelligence functions (e.g., TOTALYTD).

Automated hierarchical filters for cities/airlines, reducing user click-throughs by 30%.
📈 Outcome: Mastered Power BI’s advanced features, enabling stakeholders to pinpoint inefficiencies in airline scheduling.
